# DemoFintechApp
The project is a web application built using Blazor WebAssembly, with the purpose of providing banking services to users. It includes various features such as user authentication, managing user accounts, performing transactions, and checking account balances.

The backend of the application is implemented as an API using ASP.NET Core, providing endpoints for user registration, login, account creation, and transaction management. The API utilizes a repository pattern with a unit of work for data access and is secured using JWT authentication.

The frontend is developed with Blazor WebAssembly, allowing for a rich and interactive user interface. The user interface provides functionalities for user registration, login, viewing account details, performing debit and credit transactions, checking account balances, and transferring funds between accounts.

The application employs various technologies and practices, including Entity Framework Core for data persistence, ASP.NET Identity for user management, and JWT authentication for secure communication between the client and the server. It also utilizes DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to define the structure of data exchanged between the frontend and the backend.
